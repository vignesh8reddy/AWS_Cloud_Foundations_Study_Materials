## Section 1: Intro to Cloud Computing

**Cloud Computing:** The on-demand delivery of compute power, database, storage, applications, and other IT resources via the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. Cloud computing enables you to stop thinking of infrastructure as hardware, and instead think of (and use) it as software.

### **Traditional Computing Model**

- Infrastructure as hardware
- Hardware solutions: Require space, staff, physical security, planning, capital expenditure
- Have a long hardware procurement cycle
- Require you to provision capacity by guessing theoretical maximum peaks

### **Cloud Computing Model**

- Infrastructure as software
- Software solutions:
  - Are flexible
  - Can change more quickly, easily, and cost-effectively than hardware solutions
  - Eliminate the undifferentiated heavy-lifting tasks

Cloud service models vary on how much control you have over IT resources.

- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) - Most control
- Platform as a Service (PaaS)
- Software as a Service (SaaS) - Least control

Cloud computing deployment models

1. Cloud
2. Hybrid
3. On-premse (Private Cloud)

Cloud computing can do almost anything the traditional IT can do.

## Section 2: Advantages of Cloud Computing

- Pay only for the resources you consume (variable cost vs upfront capital expenditure)
- Economies of scale achieved by aggregate of all users
- Scaling on demand
- Speed and flexibility - changes are software level, not hardware like traditional computing
- Lower overhead due to not maintaining hardware and data centers
- Data centers are global, like a company's customer base

<br/>

## Section 3: Introduction to Amazon Web Services

**Web Service:** Any piece of software that makes itself available over the internet and uses a standardized format—such as Extensible Markup Language (XML) or JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) — for the request and the response of an application programming interface (API) interaction.

### What is AWS?

- AWS is a secure cloud platform that offers a broad set of global cloud-based products called services that are designed to work together.
- There are many categories of AWS services, and each category has many services to choose from.
- Choose a service based on your business goals and technology requirements.
- There are three ways to interact with AWS services:
  1. AWS Management Console - Graphical interface
  2. Command Line Interface (CLI) - Access via discrete commands or scripts
  3. Software Development Kits (SDK) - Access directly from code

## Section 4: The AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (AWS CAF)

- AWS CAF provides guidance and best practices to help organizations build a comprehensive approach to cloud computing across the organization and throughout the IT lifecycle to accelerate successful cloud adoption.
- AWS CAF is organized into six perspectives and perspectives consist of sets of capabilities.
  
  **Focused on Business Capabilities**
  1. Business - IT is aligned with business needs
     - IT Finance
     - IT Strategy
     - Benefits Realization
     - Business Risk Management
  2. People - training, staffing, and organizational changes
     - Resource Management
     - Incentive Management
     - Career Management
     - Training Management
     - Organizational Change Management
  3. Governance - skills and processes align IT and business strategies and goals
     - Portfolio Management
     - Program Project Management
     - Business Performance Measurement
     - License Management

  **Focused on Technical Capabilities**

  4. Platform - describe the architecture of the target state environment in detail
     - Compute Provisioning
     - Network Provisioning
     - Storage Provisioning
     - Database Provisioning
     - Systems and Solution Architechture
     - Application Development
  5. Security - the organization meets its security objectives
     - Identity and Access Management
     - Detective Control
     - Infrastructure Security
     - Data Protection
     - Incident Response
  6. Operations - define how daily, quarterly, and yearly business will be conducted
     - Service Monitoring
     - Application Performance Monitoring
     - Resource Inventory Management
     - Release Management / Change Management
     - Reporting and Analytics
     - Business Continuity / Disaster Recovery
     - IT Service Catalog
